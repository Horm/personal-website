                p Since I have started to study programming I wanted to visit some space where is possible share our knowledge and learn from each other. Luckily I have found GDG community in Czechia and after one month I joined this community, concretely I have created local chapter in Žďár nad Sázavou.
                p Now, I am active in GDG Brno. We organized many types of events like talks, workshops, coding dojos or conference DevFest. I was mentoring Angular Workshop and in 2017 I attend Google I/O in Mountain View.

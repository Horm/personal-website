# Horm's Personal Website
This repository contains sources for my personal website...

## Setup

Everything is prepared and deployed using CI/CD. I recommend setup file watcher in IDEA for automatic conversions from Pug to HTML. Steps for deployment are described in a directory called `.circleci`

## Blog

Horm's blog is hosted on separate project and the blog is using [Ghost Platform](https://ghost.org/) as a Docker container (see a directory called `blog`).
